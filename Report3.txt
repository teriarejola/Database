In the user_access.py file, we designed a program that will takes user input from command lines and subsequently performs either a search, buy, or bid operation based on that input. We developed this interface using this input format: 

        python y_program.py search minPrice=100 maxPrice=1000 category=toys

We were able to accomplish this by assigning the first argument input to the variable "userAction" and creating if-statements  for each possible input, specifically "search", "bid", and "buy". 

For the search action, we created a for-loop with a range that begins with the argument following userAction and ends with the length of "sys.argv" since the total number of arguments is undefined. 



Essentially it starts from the last table entered and combines it with the table before that until it gets the last table until all the tables are in one giant table stored at i[0]. Thi

(I just took what Quinn did and flipped it so we wouldnâ€™t risk running out of bounds)
